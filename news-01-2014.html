    Karen Dyer<br/>
    Inspiration and Co-founder of Advocacy Outreach<br/>
    December 24, 1950--November 12, 2014<br/>

    <p>Karen Dyer passed from this life on a cold night in November, ill and alone.  Her death, a cruel irony-- she had saved so many others from a similar fate during her years of working with Adult Protective Services.  She was an Adult Protective Services caseworker and I worked for the Bastrop County Women’s Shelter when we met in the late 1980’s.  She was in her 30’s, a self-confident feminist with an easy smile, quick to laugh, but ready to challenge any opponent or overcome any obstacle that interfered with her purpose: protecting her client.  Sometimes it was self-protection that a client needed; elders with dementia who were not ready to leave their unsafe homes.  On those occasions she was gentle and persuasive and didn’t give up until she had guided them to safety. But when someone was hurting another, she was fearless, staunch and stubborn, not afraid of anyone, violent abuser, police officer, district attorney.  She didn’t give up; she was an advocate.  And she was a teacher—she taught me how to find resources where none seemed available and she taught me to respect the boundaries of an individual.  On one heartbreaking occasion, I couldn’t persuade a dying alcoholic to accept EMS services--lying on her bed with an obvious swollen liver, the client, with a bottle of gin beside her, intended to drink herself to death.  As I sat sobbing outside, Karen put her arm around my shoulder and explained that part of advocacy is respecting individuals’ rights to make decisions for themselves, good or bad.  She said, “We can help people but we can’t save them.”  It was a hard lesson and my heart still hadn’t learned it, years later, when I heard of Karen’s death.</p>

    <p>Karen was the one who came up with the concept of Advocacy Outreach in 1990 when I was at a crossroads in my career.  Her work with Adult Protective Services had shown her that Elgin was badly in need of a resource center.  At that time, there was no public transportation connecting the impoverished population of Elgin with social services in Bastrop, no food stamp office, no mental health center.  Her position in a state agency precluded her from helping us incorporate or serving on the Board but she was our inspiration, our cheerleader and our advocate.  When a hiring freeze hampered Adult Protective Services from adding additional staff, she convinced administrators to contract with Advocacy Outreach to get the work done and that was the first funding that our newborn organization received.  For a year and more, we worked side by side with Karen on casework in the community.  As a team, there was no problem that we wouldn’t take on; nearly nothing that we couldn’t accomplish.  Karen and I once flew to Dallas with a client with Down ’s syndrome to give the young woman the opportunity to testify in court against a man who had kidnapped and tortured her—after the hearing we took the client to the Dallas Museum of Art, her first experience in an art museum, and we had a picnic on the grounds.  Those were good days and they were good because of Karen’s sense of joy and purpose.  She is a lasting inspiration to us and, although she is gone, Advocacy Outreach is but one of the legacies that she has left behind.</p>
