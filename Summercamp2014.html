      <strong>WHERE DO WE COME  FROM? WHAT ARE WE? WHERE ARE WE GOING?</strong></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <img src="Where1.jpg" width="491" height="212" /><br />
      The painting, made by impressionist painter, Paul Gauguin,  in Tahiti in 1975, asks the three existential questions of the painting&rsquo;s title  in its top left corner.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      Advocacy Outreach opened its four-week Family Literacy  Summer Camp on June 10, 2014, with a slide of the painting projected on the wall  of the gym at the Excel Manor ISD campus that hosted our program. Eleven parents and thirty-five children, ages  3 to 16, looked at the painting and speculated on its meaning. </p>
    <p align="left">Those questions formed the theme of the  summer program and subsequent activities and outings were conducted to examine  the questions and develop answers that related to the personal experiences of  each participant.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">We opened the program  with a Paul Gauguin painting and closed it, on July 3, with a group of Paul  Gauguin&rsquo;s lithographs on display at the Blanton Museum in the exhibition  titled, &ldquo;In the Company of Cats and Dogs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="left">      Parents and children attended sessions on the Excel campus  site Tuesdays and Wednesdays.&nbsp; Parents  were English language learners in two groups, Beginners and Advanced.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">Children were divided into four groups&mdash;Early  Childhood; K through 2nd grade; 3rd through 5th  grade; and Middle/High School.&nbsp; On  Thursdays we went on outings, family-style, to learn about our history,  ourselves and our future.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">The child  participants were children of parents learning English or homeless children  referred by the Homeless Liaison at Elgin ISD.&nbsp;  The parents of homeless children did not attend English language classes  but they were encouraged to attend Thursday field trips.&nbsp; Attendance at sessions averaged above 90%.</p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      <strong>WHERE DO WE COME  FROM?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      To help children define their own family structures and  learn about their own ancestors, we developed a letter writing campaign.&nbsp; On Tuesdays, children wrote letters to their  parents, made envelopes, stamped and delivered them to the Adult Education  classrooms, or took them home to parents.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">  Parents responded and delivered answers, by letter, to their children on  Wednesdays. We were unprepared for the  enthusiasm this activity generated. It  was a novelty.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> We knew, through  experience with adult ESL classes, that many parents from countries outside the  U.S. did not know how to address and compose a letter. But we were surprised to find how unfamiliar  the letter format was to school children.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">  In this age of electronic communication, many (most) of the children had  no experience writing or receiving a letter through the post. At first it seemed archaic to them; they were  intrigued. They loved the formal  give-and-take.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">Before the end of the  program some of the older children and parents confessed that they were able to  tell each other things in writing that they had not expressed verbally to each  other.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> Specifically, they were referring  to letters that moved to the third question:</p>
    <p align="left"> <strong>WHERE ARE WE GOING?</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Parents were describing life and career goals  that they had had for themselves and dreams they have for their children. Children  were telling parents what they hoped to be when they grow up.</p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      Participants learned  the 5 parts of a letter; developed vocabulary; learned to proofread; learned to  calculate postage by weight. And children  discovered who their lineal and lateral relatives were. Children created &ldquo;family trees.&rdquo; Parents in ESL classes learned the vocabulary  to describe familial relationships.</p>
    <p align="left"><br />

      </p>
    <p align="left"><strong>WHAT ARE WE?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      The field trips that we took provided insight into our  environmental and cultural history. We  visited the Mayborn Natural Science and Cultural History Museum Complex at  Baylor University in Waco where an interactive dinosaur exhibit held the  attention of the children.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">Walk-in  dioramas and exploration stations for geology, paleontology, archaeology and  anthropology illustrated life of the animals and humans that have populated  Texas through the eons. A Science  Discovery Hall allowed participants to go inside a room-sized model of the  human body and to learn how our bodies process sight and sound. </p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      A trip to the Austin Nature Center allowed us to examine our  role as stewards of the environment as we saw native species of birds, animals  and reptiles that have been damaged by their contact with the modern world of  man. A visit to the Blanton Museum of  Art on the University of Texas campus allowed us to see ourselves through the  eyes of artists from the classical age to the present.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> Children and their parents found an exhibit  of &ldquo;1968&rdquo; at the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum to be humorous and intriguing.&nbsp; Instructors built on material from the field  trips to encourage dialogue in classrooms about our origins, our place in the  world and our definitions of self.</p>

    <p align="left"><br />
      A consistent goal of our programming is to encourage  transitions to higher education and satisfactory careers. In addition to using the letter-writing  activity to explore educational and career goals, field trips were planned to  expose participants to college campuses.&nbsp;  </p>
    <p align="left">At University of Texas we took a walking tour of the campus.&nbsp; A young man of 16, looking at the  neoclassical architecture of the huge halls and watching the young college  students bustling about, remarked that he was making a resolution to bring his  grades up during his junior and senior years so that he could have the chance  to get into UT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> A finishing touch to  the visit to the Bob Bullock museum was a visit to the third floor exhibit of  photographs from the McDonald Observatory of space&mdash;planets, galaxies and black  holes.&nbsp; Where are we going?&nbsp; For these young people, despite the  adversities of poverty and disruption of home&mdash;the sky is the limit.</p>
