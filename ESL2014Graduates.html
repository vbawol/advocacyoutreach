    <p class="style45">Nine Outstanding Women Graduate Our ESL Program! Congratulations!</p>
    <p align="center" class="style45"><img src="grads2014a.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="177" /></p>
    <p class="style33">From left to right; Carol Joseph, instructor   with Olga Sandoval, Claudia Juarez, Catalina Gonzalez, Sandra Guevara,   Miriam Garcia, Ofelia Moctezuma, Herminia Suarez, Irene Huerta, Veronica   Rivera. </p>
    <p>Nine  participants in the Advocacy Outreach Family Literacy Program completed the  highest level of English as a Second Language and graduated from the program.  They represented more than one third of the entire class of English Language  Learners and they also represent the largest graduating group from the Advocacy  Outreach Family Literacy <br />
    Program&mdash;ever!&nbsp; </p>
    <p>All  the graduates were parents of young children. They attended a rigorous schedule  of 15 hours per week of classes which included English Literacy, parenting  workshops, and interactive sessions with their children where they helped their  children develop academic skills. Participants estimated that they also spent  an additional ten hours per week on homework.&nbsp;  The intensive schedule paid off and all nine exceeded the highest level,  Advanced English as a Second Language, as measured by the state mandated  assessment, Basic English Skills Test. <br />
      <br />
      A ceremony with caps and gowns was held  at the Manor Excel Academy on May 29, 2014, followed by a celebratory luncheon  which was attended by classmates, husbands, teachers and children. They have  all expressed their intention to continue studying and finding <br />
      opportunities to speak English.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
      Sandra is looking for a job to help support the financial needs of two of her  sons who are going to college. Miriam has a career goal of becoming a social  worker.&nbsp; Five of the graduates have jobs  now. Some are working directly with the public in stores and restaurants, using  their newly acquired fluency in English to communicate with patrons. <br />
  <br />
      Others  have taken the lessons they learned in Financial Literacy sessions to develop  entrepreneurial businesses of their own. They are assets to their community and  to their families.&nbsp; They all reported  more involvement with their children&rsquo;s schooling&mdash;they met with teachers and discussed  their children&rsquo;s progress, learned how to set up study spaces <br />
      within their homes and supervised their children&rsquo;s homework sessions.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
      Their instructor, Carol Joseph, reminded them that they have achieved what only  a small percentage of adults in the United States have achieved: bilingual  fluency.&nbsp; The ability to communicate  effectively in two languages&mdash;English and Spanish&mdash;is an undeniable asset in the  culture in which we live and work.&nbsp;  Advocacy Outreach congratulates its graduates and encourages them to  continue learning and continue to set high goals for themselves.</p>
