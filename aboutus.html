    <p class="style45">About Advocacy Outreach </p>
    <p class="style50">Advocacy Outreach was founded in 1992 with a mission to address the  crisis needs and long term goals of Central Texas  families striving to increase their economic stability.&nbsp;A Board of  Directors comprised of representatives from the social service fields of mental  health, domestic violence, disabilities and HIV/AIDS recruited volunteer  attorneys and paralegals to develop an advocacy program which helped with  issues such as Social Security disability benefits applications and appeals,  divorces, estate planning and discrimination.&nbsp;Board members and volunteers  quickly realized that homelessness and hunger were serious problems for  disabled or displaced individuals involved in lengthy legal processes and they  began to seek additional resources.&nbsp;Americorps VISTA sent in a team of  grant writing experts who helped the grassroots organization add programs that  prevented families from losing housing.&nbsp;The original founders were Sallie Humphries Wagner, <a href="debrawardell.html">Debra Brackin Wardell</a> and Beth Rolingson Besson. The first VISTA grant writing team members were Peg McIntosh, Bob Evans, and the late great Wes Bennett. </p>
    <p class="style50">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Within the first year of operations, Amy Normand, Director of Ten County  Adult Education Cooperative, paid a visit to Advocacy Outreach's (then) one  room office in downtown Elgin  and suggested that the organization address the educational needs of its client  populations. Ten County   Co-op provided funding  for a Lifeskills Class for homeless women.&nbsp;Twelve women developed a  budget, created and marketed their silk scarves in a local hand crafts  store.&nbsp;They improved their literacy and math skills, learned budget and  business skills, and increased their self-confidence.&nbsp;Subsequently,  several of the participants overcame their homeless situations.&nbsp;Thus was  the educational programming of Advocacy Outreach begun. </p>
    <p class="style50">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nearly twenty years later, Advocacy Outreach has continued and expanded  educational services to the community and currently operates a family literacy  program that addresses the literacy needs of parents and their preschool-age  children, several English as a Second Language classes in Elgin and Manor, a Citizenship  class, and hosts GED classes in collaboration with Community Action and Manor  ISD.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style50">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adult students have developed the skills and prerequisites to enter  college, job training, employment (including teaching and social work) and  careers in the military.&nbsp;Parents have learned to support the academic  progress of their children leading to school success.&nbsp;Children who were  involved in family literacy programs in the 90&rsquo;s are beginning to reach  adulthood and some are entering college, the first generation in their families  to do so.</p>
    <p align="center" class="style50"><img src="aoOffice.jpg" width="250" height="164" border="2" /></p>
    <p class="style50">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The organization now occupies a 3,000 square foot historic building in  the heart of Elgin.&nbsp;The  site houses a <a href="freethriftstore.html">Free Thrift Store</a>, the Al Guerrero Learning Center with a  computer lab and classroom, a Day Shelter for those in need, and Advocacy  Offices where clients may receive help to prevent or overcome homelessness or  assistance linking to resources they need to increase financial stability,  address health needs or personal crises.&nbsp;Federal funding from the Texas  Department of Housing and Community Affairs, Texas Education Agency and the  Federal Emergency Management Act, local funding from the City of Elgin and Bastrop   County, private  foundations and individual donations enable Advocacy Outreach to serve over one  thousand families annually.</p>
