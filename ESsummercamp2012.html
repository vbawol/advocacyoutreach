    <p align="center" class="style56"><a href="http://takepart.com/lastcall" class="style54">http://takepart.com/lastcall</a>
      <span class="style54">~ A look at our present water situation</span>
    <p align="center">~ Page 1 ~ </p>
    <p><strong>Water is everywhere upon our planet.</strong> It is the same water as  the dinosaurs drank, for there is no new water; it all just moves in natural  cycles which clean and distribute the water to our lakes and rivers and waters  our plant life. Nearly 97% of the world&rsquo;s water is ocean water which is salty  which we do not drink. About 2% of earth&rsquo;s water is locked up in ice caps and  glaciers. <strong>That leaves us only 1% for all humanities needs, including all human  agricultural needs, residential, manufacturing, community and personal needs. </strong></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="hydro_5cycle.jpg" width="340" height="281" /></p>
    <p>Our summer program focus was about Water; we studied the  water cycles, what happens to water moving in our watersheds which feed in to  our aquifers and springs. We reviewed different recycling and water treatments  options, how water gets polluted and how we can help keep our most valued  resource clean. The outings focused upon tactile and visual activities which  brings new information to the students. </p>
    <p>Parents attended their ESL classes with instructors Yadira  Lira (beginning) and Carol Joseph (intermediate), or&nbsp;attended the GED class with instructors  Michelle Austino and Kristy Taylor, while the children attended the Camp (ages  5-16) with instructors Jerretta Jimmerson, Carolyn Thompson, Clara Godkin,  Haley Kuba and Michael Thompson-Rhodes. The infants, toddlers and up to 5 year  olds enjoyed their time in our Early   Childhood Development   Center with Ethel Ellis  and Debra Hendricks. </p>
    <p align="left">On our outings we visited the LCRA Redbud   Center and enjoyed many  displays. They provided us with a Watershed activity that showed how easily pollutants  and garbage can move in to our waterways during rain.<img src="watershed1.jpg" width="285" height="186" /> </p>
    <p align="left">With a large map of Texas embedded in the walkway that defined the Highland  lakes, our guide led us through activities explaining the movement of the  Colorado River all the way to the Gulf of Mexico  at Matagorda. </p>
    <p align="right"><img src="highlandlakes3a.jpg" width="209" height="139" /></p>
    <p>One area of the LCRA Redbud teaching areas was developed to be a  showcase of drought resistant plants. Children walked through the garden to  discover the variety of plants and their usefulness. Our guide talked to us  about catching rainwater as well.</p>
    <p><img src="droughtplants1.jpg" width="210" height="148" /></p>
    <p>The camp then took a trip to the Aquarena  Center in San Marcos. We all boarded the glass bottom  boats and looked in the water for fish, turtles various plant life and the  actual spring water bubbling up from the sandy bottom. </p>
    <p align="left"><img src="glassbottomboat.jpg" width="201" height="124" /><img src="springs.jpg" width="153" height="98" /><img src="garfishhead.jpg" width="180" height="127" /></p>
    <p>The water was so very  clear and cool. Our guide took us to the roof of their building and challenged  us to show how much water goes in each container. The containers were labeled  rivers, oceans, lakes, and other places. This was to see if we knew how much  water was really available for humans, which was not very much at all! </p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="turtles.jpg" width="168" height="122" /><img src="availablewater.jpg" width="180" height="125" /> <img src="waterweeds.jpg" width="158" height="124" /></p>
    <p>Our guide  took us down to an area that had containers of micro organisms that were  present in this spring water lake. The children could scoop out a few and look  at them close up with magnifying glasses and identify the types using charts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Later we gathered around a picnic table and charted which organism ate which  other organism. This chart got very complicated with many lines going to all  varieties. </p>
    <p align="right"><img src="chainoffood.jpg" width="227" height="186" /></p>
    <p>We discovered that if some species died out, then others that  depended upon them would also die out. Life in the water was all connected. We  later played a game involving the Water Cycle, moving about to different places  water traveled during its natural cycle. The guides at Aquarena were very  informative and provided us with some great learning opportunities. </p>
